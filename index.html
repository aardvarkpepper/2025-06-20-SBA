<!-- 


add, update task status (In Progress, Completed, Overdue), autoupdate task status based on current date
tasks past deadline Overdue
filter tasks by status or category
persist task data using local storage so tasks are saved even after refreshing package

each task stored as object with properties. objects stored in array that holds all tasks
create html structure (unorderd list or table) to display tasklist - each task shows
task name, category, deadline, status.
dynamically update task list in browser each time a new task is added or a status is updated.

allow users to update the status of tasks (e.g. "in progress" or "completed") via a dropdown button
autocheck each task deadline and mark overdue if current date has passed deadline
update displayed task list whenever a task's status changes.

add functionality to filter tasks by category or status. provide dropdown or set of buttns for users
to choose a filter

when a filter is selected only display tasks that match the selected category or status

persisting task data with local storage - save current state of task list so tasks restored when
page refreshed. Ensure task data stored and retrieved correctly.

Use an array to store tasks, each represented as an object.
Write functions to add tasks, update task status, check overdue tasks, and filter tasks.
Use DOM manipulation to display the task list dynamically.
Implement local storage to persist task data.

Add multiple tasks and ensure they are displayed correctly.
Test the “Update Status” functionality to ensure tasks can be marked as “Completed” or “Overdue.”
Filter tasks by status or category and ensure the correct tasks are displayed.
Refresh the page and ensure the tasks are restored from local storage.

Keep your code modular: Use functions to organize your logic and make your code more readable and maintainable.
Think about the user experience: Ensure that the task list is easy to read and that users receive clear feedback when
updating or filtering tasks.

Include a brief README.md explaining how the app works and any additional features you have implemented.
